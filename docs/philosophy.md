> As you may have already read, Spaz is *not* like your traditional C-like programming languages. It has some fundamental differences. The main difference is that it is `stack based`.

> A stack is a fundamental data structure of computer science that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) concept. 
  When data is `pushed` into it, that data always goes to the top of the stack. When data is `popped` out of it, that data
  always comes of the top. This constraint is what makes a stack, a stack.
