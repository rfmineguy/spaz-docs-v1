# Learn Spaz
## Expressions

Spaz expressions are a combination of:
1. Mathematical expressions
2. Logical expressions
3. Stack operations
4. Procedure calls


### Mathematical Expressions
Grammar:  `<expression> <expression> <operator>`
```spaz
3 5 +   // this is equivalent to (3 + 5)
9 1.4 - // this is equivalent to (9 - 1.4)
```

Ok.. these are too simple. What about longer mathematical expressions? <br>
Well Spaz supports those as well... obviously.
```spaz
4 9 * 4 / 3 4 - *
```
Ok what in the world is that???!!! <br>
If you've ever seen postfix notation you will know exactly what this is!! But for those who haven't seen it, postfix notation (also know as reverse polish notation) is an alternative method of performing mathematical operations that has operator precedence built in!


### Function Call Expressions
