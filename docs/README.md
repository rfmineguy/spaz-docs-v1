# Spaz
> A programming language written entirely in C for the purpose of learning and exploring language development

# About me, the developeer
> My name is Riley Fischer, and I am a student of computer science.
I transferred from community college to a university, where I enrolled in a programming languages class.
Here I learned a lot about different programming languages and how some of them are implemented, so I got inspired to try to write my own interpreter for a language I made up, hence Spaz.
I've had the itch to write a programming language for around 2 years now at least (as of April of 2024), and only now do I feel like I know enough to pull it off.

# My inspiration
> I have to give all the credit to a man that goes by @Tsoding online. He had a project that he worked on where he was implementing the Forth programming language in Python, hence the clever name of Porth (Python Forth). The series of him working on this language was interesting because I got to see this language grow in semi realtime! Without his series I would have never gone down this road of language design and implementation, and I thank him for that.

# Why "Spaz"
> The name stems from a personal trait of mine. I am generally a clumsy guy whose actions are mostly intentional, but sometimes my body just decides to **spaz** out.

# About Spaz
> This is not a traditional C-like programming language. It is what is called a stack based programming language, which means all operations are oriented around a global stack of values. It is an open source project (in the sense that the source code is freely available to look at), however I'm not necessarily interested in having contributions at this point in time. To learn more about the philosophy of Spaz, see [Philosophy](/#Philosophy). To install spaz, see [Installation](/#Installation). Then finally move over to [Learn](/#Learn) to get into the code!
