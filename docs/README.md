# Spaz Lang
> A programming language written entirely in C for the purpose of learning and exploring language development

# About me, the developeer
> My name is Riley Fischer, and I am a student of computer science.
I transferred from community college to a university, where I enrolled in a programming languages class.
Here I learned a lot about different programming languages and how some of them are implemented, so I got inspired to try to write my own interpreter for a language I made up, hence Spaz.
I've had the itch to write a programming language for around 2 years now at least, and only now do I feel like I know enough to pull it off.

# About Spaz
> This is not a traditional C-like programming language. It is what is called a stack based programming language, which means all operations are oriented around a global stack of values.
